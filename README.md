# Family-Tree
This is a pge made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It shows a family tree where the nodes of the tree are clickable and would direct the user to another page where the information of that particular "family member" is shown. 

I used d3.js, a javascript library that helps to bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.
